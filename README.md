# Problem statement

### _It's dinner time!_ Create an application that helps users find the most relevant recipes that they can prepare with the ingredients that they have at home

## Objective

Deliver a prototype web application to answer the above problem statement.

__âœ… Must have's__

- A back-end with Ruby on Rails (If you don't know Ruby on Rails, refer to the FAQ)
- A SQL-compliant relational database
- A well-thought user experience

__ðŸš« Don'ts__

- Excessive effort in styling
- Features which don't directly answer the above statement
- Over-engineer your prototype

## Deliverable

- The codebase should be pushed on the current GitHub private repository.
- 2 or 3 user stories that address the statement in your repo's `README.md`.
- The application accessible online (a personal server, fly.io or something else).
- Submission of the above via [this form](https://forms.gle/siH7Rezuq2V1mUJGA).
- If you're on Mac, make sure your browser has [permission to share the screen](https://support.apple.com/en-al/guide/mac-help/mchld6aa7d23/mac).

## User Stories

### 1. As a home cook, I want to search for recipes using ingredients I have at home, so that I can decide what to cook without making a grocery trip.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can enter multiple ingredients separated by commas
- The system shows me recipes that use those ingredients
- I can choose to find recipes with ALL or ANY of my ingredients
- Search results show recipe details like cooking time and ratings

### 2. As a busy person, I want to quickly browse recipes by category and see essential information at a glance, so that I can make quick cooking decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can view all recipes in an organized grid layout
- I can filter recipes by category (Italian, Indian, etc.)
- Each recipe card shows key information: time, rating, category
- I can click to view full recipe details including ingredient list

### 3. As someone looking for cooking inspiration, I want to discover new recipes through featured content and popular ingredients, so that I can try something different.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The homepage shows featured recipes to inspire me
- I can see popular ingredients used across recipes
- I can click on popular ingredients to find related recipes
- The interface guides me from inspiration to actionable cooking plans

### 4. As a home cook who wants detailed guidance, it would not be enough for me to just get a list of ingredients. I need to be able to get detailed instructions on how to cook the dish. AI should be leveraged in order to acheive it

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can request AI cooking advice for any recipe by clicking "Ask Alchemist for how to cook it"
- The AI provides detailed step-by-step cooking instructions tailored to the recipe
- The AI includes helpful cooking tips, techniques, and timing advice
- For recipes that already have AI instructions, I can access them via "Check out Alchemist cooking advice" 
- The AI advice is stored and can be viewed again without re-generating, to conserve usage tokens
- The interface clearly shows which recipes have AI cooking steps available

## Data

Please start from the following dataset to perform the assignment:
[english-language recipes](https://pennylane-interviewing-assets-20220328.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/recipes-en.json.gz) scraped from www.allrecipes.com with [recipe-scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers)

Download it with this command if the above link doesn't work:
```sh textWrap
wget https://pennylane-interviewing-assets-20220328.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/recipes-en.json.gz && gzip -dc recipes-en.json.gz > recipes-en.json

<summary><i>I'm a back-end developer or don't know React, what do I do?</i></summary>

Just make the simplest UI, style isn't important and server rendered HTML pages will do!

<details>
<summary><i>Can I have a time extension for the test?</i></summary>

No worries, we know that unforeseen events happen, simply reach out to the recruiter you've been
